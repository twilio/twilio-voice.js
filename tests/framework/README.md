# Framework Tests

Framework Tests ensure twilio-voice.js works with popular JavaScript frameworks,
such as

* No Framework (Script tag)
* React

With each of these frameworks, there are a variety of ways to use them,
complicating the task of ensuring twilio-voice.js actually works with them. We
focus on the most common use casesâ€”for example, React apps created with
`create-react-app` or Angular apps created from the Quickstart seed.

## Test Application

Each Framework Test project implements essentially the same Test Application.
The Test Application

1. Reads an Access Token from a `token` parameter in the URL,
2. Calls Device.setup using the `token`,
3. Returns on a successful Device.ready callback.

## Consuming Framework Tests

The twilio-voice.js build process will

1. Reinstall each Framework Test from scratch,
2. Run any project-specific tests, and finally
3. Exercise the Test Application using Selenium.
